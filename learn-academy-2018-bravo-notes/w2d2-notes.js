-------------------Iterables and Higher Order Functions----------------------

*Higher order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments
*The filter() method creates an array filled with elements that pass specified criteria
(note) filter() does not execute the for array elements without values
(note) filter() does not change the original array

a "let" variable decleration can only be used once
a "var" variable decleration can be multiple times
